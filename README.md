## Setup in Pelican

### Setup Egg

Set up the Generic C# egg in your Pelican Panel like normal.

### Configuration

Set the following variables exactly like this
```
- Git Repo Address: https://github.com/SirZeeno/Pelican-Keeper
- Install Branch: main
- Project Location: /home/container/Pelican Keeper/
- Project File: "Pelican Keeper"
```
### Secrets

Run the bot once or create the Secrets.json in the base directory you see when opening the Files tab and fill out all the necessary information.

## Setup Outside Pelican
> [!TIP]
> You will need curl installed.

### Get The Latest Release

Download the latest release with this command. This command downloads the latest release, unzips it, and removes the zip file.
```
curl -L https://github.com/SirZeeno/Pelican-Keeper/releases/latest/download/Release.zip && unzip Release.zip && rm Release.zip
```

### Run the Bot
> [!WARNING]
> At this point you should create the Secrets.json in the directory the bot resides in, otherwise the first run will result in an error.<br>
> If you don't create the Secrets.json, the bot will create a default one for you that you will need to fill out.<br>
> After the first run, the bot will have created the Secrets.json. At that point it's your responsibility to fill out with all the necessary information.

while still in the same directory to start the bot, you simply run this command
```
dotnet run --project "Pelican Keeper"
```

## Secrets

> [!TIP]
> The Server and Client Tokens are API keys you generate from your Pelican panel.
> The Admin page is where you can generate the server API token, and the client API token is under the Profile settings.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you fill out the Secrets.json file found in the bot install directory, otherwise the bot **WILL NOT** work!

**Secrets.json Structure**
```
{
  "ClientToken": "YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN",
  "ServerToken": "YOUR_SERVER_TOEKN",
  "ServerUrl": "YOUR_BASIC_SERVER_URL",
  "BotToken": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
  "ChannelIds": [THE_CHANNELID_YOU_WANT_THE_BOT_TO_POST_IN],
  "ExternalServerIP": "YOUR_EXTERNAL_SERVER_IP"
}
```
> The ExternalServerIP variable is optional and is used to display the server's public IP alongside the primary game server port. This provides a visible, joinable IP address as part of the server information.

## Configuration

### Config File

> [!TIP]
> The Config file can be found in [here](https://github.com/SirZeeno/Pelican-Keeper/blob/main/Pelican%20Keeper/Config.json).
> This file is used to configure how the bot behaves and displays information in Discord.
> You can edit this file to change the bot's behavior, changing it while the bot is running will not apply the changes until the next restart.

The config.json file can be found in the installation folder, and the structure and what each setting does is explained
in the [Wiki](https://github.com/SirZeeno/Pelican-Keeper/wiki/Bot-Config)

### ConsolidateEmbeds

> Consolidate all the server information into a single embed message if true. And if false, it will create an embed message for each game server you have on pelican.
> 
> Note that you will run into discord rate limits if you have this option off, and you have a few game servers on pelican.

### Paginate

> Paginates the server information into a single embed message with changeable pages.
> 
> Note that the page will be the same serverwide, meaning if someone changed the page, it changes it for you as well.

### Markdown Formatting
> [!TIP]
> The Markdown file can be found in [here](https://github.com/SirZeeno/Pelican-Keeper/blob/main/Pelican%20Keeper/MessageMarkdown.txt).

The Markdown formatting uses [Discord's](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline) formatting with some slight modifications.<br>
Anything marked with {{}} will be replaced with the variable name.<br>
Finally, There is a special Tag called [Title] for the server Name to mark what is supposed to be the server name for special use in the title of the embed.
